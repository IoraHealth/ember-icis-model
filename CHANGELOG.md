# CHANGELOG

## 0.1.0
* Added PatientAutocomplete model
* Added AccessToken Service. This service allows us to inject an access token
into our model adapters and set appropriate bearer token headers. We can set
this access token in our routers, hopefully done so by an auth addon in the
near future.
